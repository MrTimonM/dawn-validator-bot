## Features

- **Supports Multiple Accounts**: Manage multiple user accounts simultaneously for efficiency.
- **Proxy Binding for Each Account**: Automatically assign a unique proxy to each account.
- **One Proxy per Account**: Each account gets its own proxy to reduce IP bans.
- **Multithreading**: Handle multiple accounts concurrently for better performance.
- **Colored Output**: Log messages are color-coded for easy reading.
- **Retry on Connection Failures**: Automatically retry operations if a connection fails.
- **Error Handling**: Manage exceptions and provide meaningful feedback.
- **Bugs for Future Fixes**: Iâ€™ve added some bugs to fix them later.


## Installation

Install Python 3.10+ 

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  configure accounts.json 
  configure proxy.json

```
**Note**: Config.json file does not work yet. I will complete the code in my free time. And for proxy, you need to strictly follow this pattern: 
```bash
  "socks5://ip:port:username:password"

```
And make sure to add more proxy than your total number of accounts.
